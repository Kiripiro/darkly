## Preamble

When you develop your first websites, you will have absolutely no clue regarding the risks
they will be exposed to in the World Wide Web.

This little project is here to teach you the basics: you will learn about these risks
and vulnerabilities while auditing a simple website. This website shows breaches, some
of which still show on well established websites you visit on a daily basis.

Here is a major introduction to general vulnerabilities you will face on the World
Wide Web.

## Introduction

Darkly is a deliberately vulnerable web application designed for educational purposes.
It mimics real-world scenarios where security flaws are present, providing you with
a safe environment to test, identify, and understand common vulnerabilities.

You will discover **OWASP**, which simply is the largest cyber security project to this
day. OWASP provides valuable insights into the top vulnerabilities that affect web
applications globally.

---

## Objectives

This project aims to make you discover cyber security in the field of the WWW.

- Learn the fundamentals of web security and vulnerability identification.
- Discover and exploit **14 known vulnerabilities** inspired by the OWASP Top Ten.
- Understand how to mitigate these vulnerabilities in real-world applications.
- Develop ethical hacking skills and best practices.

## General Instructions

1. **Ethical Use Only**: This project is for educational purposes only. Do not use the
   skills learned here for malicious purposes.
2. **Stay in Scope**: Limit your testing to the Darkly environment.
3. **Document Findings**: Keep a record of the vulnerabilities you find and explain how to fix them.
4. **Ask Questions**: If you encounter difficulties, seek help or consult the OWASP documentation.

## Mandatory Part

Your task is to identify and understand **14 vulnerabilities** embedded in the Darkly application.
Each vulnerability corresponds to a key concept from the OWASP Top Ten list. Document your findings
as you go, including:

- How the vulnerability can be exploited.
- The potential risks associated with the vulnerability.
- Steps to mitigate or fix the vulnerability.
